  "aboutTarot": "🌘 The Mystery of Tarot — A Path to Truth Tarot is more than just fortune-telling. It’s an ancient mystical system that carries the wisdom of Egypt, Babylon, and Greece through the ages.",
  "78cards": "Each of the 78 Tarot cards is not a random image, but a key to understanding the hidden processes unfolding in your life. The number 78 holds magical significance not only in esotericism but also in Kabbalah. It reflects the deep connection between the macrocosm and the microcosm — between you and the Universe. Through Tarot, you can do more than glimpse the future. You can uncover your true essence, reveal your purpose, and find a path through doubt and chaos.",
  "aboutService": "On our website, we've created something far beyond a simple online Tarot reading. You won’t find generic spreads or vague phrases here. Every reading is crafted individually — attuned to your energy, your situation, your question. Because true Tarot is not a game or a form of entertainment. It is a genuine tool for insight, spiritual exploration, and illumination.",
  "beforeBegin": "Before start...",
  "preparation": "True Tarot calls for respect and stillness. Turn off your devices. Create a space of solitude. Light a candle. Take a few deep breaths. Turn inward and sense the question that wants to surface. It shouldn’t be a vague curiosity, but a true call from the heart. Only then can the cards speak to you with honesty and clarity. When you feel inwardly ready, choose your cards intuitively. Don’t overthink it — trust your inner knowing.",

The AI's interpretation didn't tell her what to do. Instead, it explained that the card pointed to a deep emotional need for fulfillment that her current job might no longer provide.

In a relationship, this is about constant small acts of love—comfort, food, affection, coziness—through which the connection becomes fertile, and intimacy naturally expands.",
    "glossary_major_00_the_emperor_desc": "Structure and boundaries: the pillars of a relationship, agreements, and a container in which intimacy remains gentle. The card reminds us that stability is born from clear rules and responsibility: who is responsible for what, how we resolve disputes, what rhythm works for us—this is how security and trust are built.",

    "glossary_major_00_death_desc": "The end of a phase and transformation: saying goodbye to the old form of a connection for the space of what's alive. In a relationship, this is not necessarily the end, but the end of a former way of being—it's painful yet liberating; allowing something to die so that something more honest and warm can be born.",

    "glossary_major_00_the_devil_desc": "Attachments and the shadow of desires: shame-fueled power, codependent contracts, and an honest look at what holds you back and constricts you. In a relationship, this is about talking about dependency, jealousy, compulsive patterns, and hidden benefits—seeing them without moralizing to regain the freedom of choice and intimacy.",
    "glossary_major_00_the_tower_desc": "Sudden clarification: illusions and false supports crumble; the pain of truth frees the relationship's breath. In a partnership, this is a crisis of honesty—unpleasant, but healing: what cannot be built upon falls, so that we can create a foundation that corresponds to reality.",
    "glossary_major_00_the_star_desc": "Hope and gentle healing: vulnerability as a light; a distant guidepost you want to walk towards without force. In a relationship, this is a quiet, warm belief in each other, where after storms, we water the connection with kindness and tenderness, allowing it to recover naturally.",
    "glossary_major_00_the_moon_desc": "Uncertainty and projections: fears and dreams that distort the picture; bodily sensitivity is more important than hasty conclusions. In a partnership, this is a time for fewer interpretations and more reality checks: talk about fears, lean on facts and your body, not on the mind's nightmares.",
    "glossary_major_00_the_sun_desc": "Simplicity and joy: a clear connection, playfulness, a warm 'togetherness' with lots of light and less protection. In a relationship, this is about visibility and sincerity—being yourself boldly, sharing happiness, and creating shared joyful rituals that nourish the connection every day.",
    "glossary_major_00_judgement_desc": "The call and awakening: reconnecting with yourself/truth, re-evaluating the past, and giving an honest response to the present. In a partnership, this is 'waking up' and choosing again: acknowledging mistakes, letting go of old roles, and hearing what truly calls the two of you forward.",
    "glossary_major_00_the_world_desc": "Wholeness and completion: a feeling of 'I am where I belong,' an openness to the world, and the maturity to be with another without losing yourself.

    "glossary_wands_2_desc": "Choosing the direction of the impulse: where to direct the fire of interest and how to align it with reality. In a partnership, this is a discussion of prospects and boundaries: how we see the future of the connection and what pace will be gentle for both.",
    "glossary_wands_3_desc": "Horizons and anticipation: the excitement of a meeting/phase, looking beyond the usual circle. In a relationship, this is about planning that fuels hope: shared goals, trips, and steps where anticipation becomes a warm preparation, not a freeze.",
    "glossary_wands_4_desc": "Support and celebration: a shared space where you want to be; a small shared ritual of joy. In a partnership, this is 'our home'—not just a place, but a feeling that it's safe and fun to be together; celebrate milestones and establish warm traditions.",
    "glossary_wands_5_desc": "Sparks of friction: a rivalry of impulses, a play of forces where it's important to remember respect. In a relationship, conflict can be a game of growth if the rules are honest: talk about needs without resorting to insults, and look for a win-win.",
    "glossary_wands_6_desc": "Visibility and recognition: a noticeable feeling, the sparkling spark of 'I am seen/I see you.' In a partnership, this is about public and private support: being proud of each other, giving feedback, and celebrating successes—this keeps the fire from going out.",
    "glossary_wands_7_desc": "Standing your ground: 'my yes/no' with dignity; a stance without war. In a relationship, this is a healthy defense of your boundaries without punishing your partner—clarity instead of attack, respect instead of giving in out of fear.",
    "glossary_wands_8_desc": "Swift flows: messages, sudden meetings, the movement of energy between you. In a partnership, this is about timely communication and initiative: responding with your heart, not delaying, and catching the moment when the connection comes alive on its own.",
    "glossary_wands_9_desc": "Tiredness and guarding the boundary: protecting your energy so you don't confuse defense with care. In a relationship, it's important to honestly admit where you've burned out and to recover, so you don't turn intimacy into a battlefield.",
    "glossary_wands_10_desc": "Overload with passion/tasks: too much fire—it's important to distinguish between desire and obligation. In a partnership, this is about redistributing burdens and expectations; otherwise, attraction becomes a weight; remove the excess and give play its place.",
    "glossary_wands_page_desc": "Curiosity and flirting: trial sparks, a game, learning the language of attraction. In a relationship, this is a time for light gestures and bold but gentle confessions, so the fire grows without pressure.",
    "glossary_wands_knight_desc": "Swiftness: a powerful impulse that asks for a channel and consent. In a partnership, this is about initiative and adventure—moving, but aligning on turns so that speed doesn't cause hurt.",
